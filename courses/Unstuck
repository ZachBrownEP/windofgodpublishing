Title:
Unstuck: Breaking the Spiritual Resistance to Finish Your Book


Description:
You didn’t lose the call.

You encountered resistance.



If you started your book in obedience but now feel stuck, discouraged, or unsure how to move forward, this isn’t a writing problem—it’s a spiritual one.



Fear of exposure.

Perfectionism.

Warfare against the assignment.

A quiet loss of confidence.



This focused, Spirit-led mini-course will help you identify what’s really blocking your manuscript, break agreement with delay, and realign with God’s original instruction—so you can finish what He asked you to begin.



In this course, you will:
Discern whether the resistance is fear, warfare, or timing

Reclaim spiritual authority over your manuscript

Break agreements with perfectionism and delay

Restore clarity, confidence, and peace

Move forward with obedience and momentum



Short. Focused. Anointed.

Each lesson is 15–20 minutes and designed to help you get unstuck—spiritually first, then practically.



“The hands that laid the foundation will also finish it.” — Zechariah 4:9
